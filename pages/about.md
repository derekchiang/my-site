##### ![](/images/me.jpg)

My name is Derek Chiang (姜恩池 in Chinese).

I'm a coder, software engineer, computer scientist, whatever you call it.  My laptop is an extension of my body; Internet that of my mind.

I'm currently a sophomore at Cornell studying computer science (surprise!!). I'm especially interested in [distributed systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing), which is basically the study of a network of computers.

When I'm not coding or reading technical papers, you will most likely find me playing (or [watching](http://www.nba.com/)) basketball, [table tennis](http://cornell-pingpong-ranking.herokuapp.com/), or [Counter Strike](http://blog.counter-strike.net/).  Definitely contact me if you want to [play Counter Strike together](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198077073825) by the way.

Duplications are bad, so please refer to [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/derekchiang93) for my résumé and [Github](https://github.com/derekchiang) for my (public) projects.
