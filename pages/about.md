# About

##### ![](/images/me.jpg)

My name is Derek Chiang (姜恩池 in Chinese).  I'm working at [Pachyderm](http://pachyderm.io/), where we are building a new data analytics platform that blows away the competition (e.g. Hadoop) in terms of usability.

When I'm not coding or reading technical documents, you will most likely find me playing (or watching) basketball, chess, or video games.

Duplications are bad, so please refer to [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/derekchiang93) for my résumé and [Github](https://github.com/derekchiang) for my (public) projects.
