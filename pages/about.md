# About

My name is Derek Chiang (姜恩池 in Chinese).

I'm a coder, software engineer, computer scientist, whatever you call it.  My laptop is an extension of my body; Internet that of my mind.

I'm currently a sophomore at Cornell studying computer science (surprise!!).  Among all the areas of CS I've explored, distributed systems and programming languages interest me the most.  Other than computer science, I also like astronomy and literature a lot.

While I can code in a variety of programming languages, Python, [Go](http://golang.org/), [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/), and JavaScript are my go-tos.  I try to be as much of a generalist as possible, but most of my personal projects are related to the web.  Recently, I have been working on [some](http://hyperdex.org/) [system-level](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) [software](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils).

When I'm not coding, you will most likely find me playing (or [watching](http://www.nba.com/)) basketball, [table tennis](http://cornell-pingpong-ranking.herokuapp.com/), or [Counter Strike](http://blog.counter-strike.net/).  Definitely contact me if you want to [play Counter Strike together](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198077073825) by the way.

Duplications are bad, so please refer to [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/derekchiang93) for my résumé and [Github](https://github.com/derekchiang) for my (public) projects.
