# About

##### ![](/images/me.jpg)

My name is Derek Chiang (姜恩池 in Chinese).

I'm a coder, software engineer, computer scientist, whatever you call it.  My laptop is an extension of my body; Internet that of my mind.

I'm currently a senior at Cornell studying computer science (surprise!!). I'm especially interested in [distributed systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing), which is basically the study of a network of computers.

When I'm not coding or reading technical documents, you will most likely find me playing (or watching) basketball, chess, or video games.

Duplications are bad, so please refer to [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/derekchiang93) for my résumé and [Github](https://github.com/derekchiang) for my (public) projects.
