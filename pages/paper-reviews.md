Most undergraduate-level students do not bother with reading technical papers, and yet I think it's the single most underrated way to gain a deep understanding of computer science.  On this site, I will be publishing reviews for some of the papers I have read.  Each review is intended to give a succinct overview of the technical insights of one particular paper.  Because of my personal taste, most papers will be related to operating systems, distributed systems, and networking.  It's my hope that these reviews will help bridge the gap between industrial software engineering and cutting-edge academic research.

All reviews are maintained in [this repo](https://github.com/derekchiang/Paper-Reviews).  Contributions are very welcome and are accepted through pull requests.  You may edit my reviews or submit reviews of your own.
